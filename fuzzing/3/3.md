# Bug 3: Stack overflow


## Description (2 points)
The _parse_internal() function implemented in parse.cpp:117 calls itself recursively in different instances: an overwhelming number of recursive calls can completely fill the stack, leading to a stack overflow.

When a '(' character is provided as part of a regex, a recursive call is performed in parse.cpp:131.
As a consequence, if an input with a high enough number of open parentheses is provided, a stack overflow will happen, causing the program to crash.

## Suggested Fix (1 point)
Multiple solutions may be adopted in order to solve the problem.

In the stub, it is possible to limit the size of the provided regex. This solution, however, does not fix the problem itself, but rather avoids triggering it, and is therefore not desirable.

As a 'depth' parameter is already present in the _parse_internal() funtion, the easiest and preferred solution is to only allow recursion to reach up to a certain depth, and trigger an error in case said depth is passed.
