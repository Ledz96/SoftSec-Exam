# Bug 4: Stack overflow


## Description (2 points)
The destructor of the class RegularExpression is defined recursively: in RegularExpression.cpp:20, a delete for the object referred to in the 'next_' attribute of the current object is called.  
In case a long linked list is defined, this may lead to stack overflow.

When a repeat N expression is created in parse.cpp:103, the number of nodes is defined by an integer specified in the regex. In case the integer is too big, too big of a linked list will be created.  
This will then be cause of stack overflow when a delete is called on the node.

## Suggested Fix (1 point)
In order to fix the bug, it is enough to only allow numbers up to a certain threshold for the size of the linked list in the repeatNExpression, causing an error in case a number bigger than the threshold is provided.
