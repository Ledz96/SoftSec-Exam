# Bug 1: Out-of-bounds read on heap buffer


## Description (2 points)
There exists an out-of-bounds access to a heap-allocated buffer at
parse.cpp:123.

When the user provides a regex pattern with at least two nested capture groups
(a capture group is a regex expression surrounded by parantheses), the parser
mishandles the closing paranthesis of the inner group and consumes that of the
outer group. When the parser moves on to the closing paranthesis of the outer
group, it attempts to access data outside the bounds of the original pattern,
leading to a buffer over-read.


## Proof of Concept (1 point)

## Suggested Fix (1 point)
When handling the closing paranthesis, make sure that no characters are consumed
needlessly. In our case, the parser inadvertently consumes the inner closing
paranthesis without processing them, then consumes the outer paranthesis as part
of processing the inner capture group. This is an off-by-one bug that can be
fixed by removing the additional `stmp++; ltmp--;` in handling the closing
parantheses.
