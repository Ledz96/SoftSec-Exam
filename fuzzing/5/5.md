# Bug 5: Unsigned integer overflow


## Description (2 points)
In the function try_parse_range, implemented starting from parse.cpp:21, an unsigned integer may be calculated, based on the user input. This number might overflow, leading to an unsigned integer overflow.

In the line parse.cpp:59, the value of max is multiplied by 10 and added to a digit between 0 and 9, based on the input. With a very large number following a comma, 'max' will overflow.

## Suggested Fix (1 point)
In order to fix the bug, it is enough to perform a check before increasing the value of 'max', to make sure that the resulting value is still lower than the maximum unsigned int.
