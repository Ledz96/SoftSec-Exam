# Bug 2: Null pointer dereference


## Description (2 points)
The delete performed at parse.cpp:239:9 is sometimes being called on an already deleted pointer, leading to a heap use after free that crashes the program.

When the user provides a regex pattern containing an error after a certain number of allowed characters (for example, an umbalanced closed parenthesis, as in the input presented), the program jumps to an 'error' label, where, after checking they are not nullptr, it first deletes the pointer 'head', then 'next'. The way destructors are implemented, however, leads to the destruction not only of head, but also of all the objects of the linked list. Therefore, if 'next' still points to an object that has been added to the linked list in the previous step, it will be first deleted in the call to head's destructor, leading to an error when the second delete is called.

## Suggested Fix (1 point)
Multiple solutions may be adopted in order to solve the problem.

A first approach might be to only delete the 'next' pointer in case its value might have changed from the previous step, and only delete head otherwise. On a more careful analysis, we may however infer that, with the current implementation, there is no way that 'next' may change value right before an error.

A second approach, based on what we stated previously, could be to just avoid deleting the object pointed by 'next': in fact, with the current implementation, it will always be deleted along with the delete of 'head'.

The proposed solution, however, is more simple: by setting next to nullptr right after it is assigned or added to the head pointer, the following check will always state that next == nullptr, and the delete will not be performed.
