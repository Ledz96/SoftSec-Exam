# Description

The function calculates the sum of the squares of all the elements in a tree. 
The root of the tree (a pointer, of the type struct node*) is passed as the argument. 
The function then goes recursively in depth, first on the left and then on the right, until it finds a NULL pointer. 
This way, it calculates for each node its own square, and sums it with the ones calculated recursively for the nodes on the left and the right (0 is returned if no node is present). 
In the last step, the square of the element of the root will be summed with the squares of all the elements at its left and at its right, with each having been calculated recursively and summed.
The final sum is returned as uint32_t. 

The tree node contains a value (int32_t) as well as two pointers, one to the left and one to the right child node (struct node*).
