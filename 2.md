# Description

The function recursively performs a binary search in a tree, finally returning a pointer contained in the node of the tree that contains the researched string.
The root of the tree (a pointer, of the type struct node*) is passed as the argument. 
The function then goes recursively in depth, comparing the target string to the one contained in the current node: if the two match, then the object of interest is returned. In case the two don't match, the same function will be recursively called on the left or right node, depending on the target being alphabetically before or after the current node's string.
In case a NULL node is reached, NULL is returned as the value of the pointer to the researched object.
It is interesting to note that, as the returned object is an 8 bytes pointer, nothing can be actually inferred on the exact returned object's type. 
In this implementation, it has been chosen to return a pointer to an uint64, treating it as the index of the object.
The index is returned as a uint64_t*. 

The tree node contains two pointers, one to the left and one to the right child node (struct node*), one string (or more precisely a character pointer, char*) and one unsigned long pointer (uint64_t*).
