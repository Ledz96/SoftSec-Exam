# Description

The function calculates the first argument to the power of the second one.
The base (signed long, int64_t) is passed as the argument along with the exponent (unsigned long uint64_t). 
The function first calculates the first 4 powers of the base, and stores them in an array. A loop follows.
In each step, the temporary result (initialized to 1) is first risen to the power of 4; this is then multiplied by the base to the power of 0, 1, 2 or 3.
In order to determine which of the 4 elements to multiply, two bits of the binary representation of the exponent are taken in each step, as determined by the value of 'left_shift'.
Following this, 'left_shift' is decremented by 2, and the step is repeated taking the immediately less significant bits than the one taken in the previous step.
The loop ends when all the bits have been considered (and left_shift reaches a negative value, or, being an unsigned variable, overflows).
The result is returned as a long (int64_t).
