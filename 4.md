# Description

The function performs a memcpy, copying 'size' bytes from the src pointer to the destination one.  
The arguments are two void pointers (void* src and void* dst), and a long unsigned integer (uint64_t), that represents the size (might have been a size_t if its use was allowed).  
In order to make the interface similar to the one of the existing memcpy, it was chosen to pass the pointers as Void pointers, and then cast them to byte pointers (uint8_t*, but might have been any byte-long type) immediately.  
The function starts with a small loop, where, if the size of the data to copy is not a multiple of 8, the first (size % 8) bytes are copied from source to destination.  
The pointers are directly overwritten, so that src always points at the next byte to copy and dst to the next byte to overwrite.  
At this point, if the total size is greater or equal to 8 bytes, block of 8 bytes are copied from src to dst, and the pointers are consequently updated.  
When the copied variable reaches the size of the biggest multiple of 8 smaller or equal to size (as at most size bytes will be copied in this loop, but less if size is not a multiple of 8), the loop will stop.  
No data is returned, but changes in the pointed data (but not of the values of the pointers!) will be visible in the calling function.
